// Need To take The Part 1 Ok...




















Creating a Simple Function for PowerShell:

  //Write-Host "I have Dell Laptops With Windows Os"
  
  Function Get-MachineInfo{
    
    Write-Host "I have Dell Laptops With Windows Os"
  
  }
  
  Get-MachineInfo // for calling purpose.
  
 Short Name of Get-childitem command --> gci function:\Get-MachineInfo  | f1*    // It will gives us all the info reading the function in powershell.
 
  
  Every PowerShell Command is made of two Parts 1:- Verb and Noun  {It is used in Naming Convention too.}


Scope of a function is by-default it is written..
We can made it global scope any time by adding a "Global" modifier.

for example:- 
    Function Global: Get-MachineInfo{
    
    Write-Host "I have Dell Laptops With Windows Os"
  
  }
